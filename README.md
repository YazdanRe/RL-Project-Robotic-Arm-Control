# RL-Project-Robotic-Arm-Control
Design and implement an RL agent to control a robotic arm in a reaching task. The agent should learn to move the robot’s end-effector to a target location in continuous action space. The project aims to compare RL algorithms such as PPO and SAC, and evaluate their robustness under environment modifications.
